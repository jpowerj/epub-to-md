b) Donald N. Wilber, Iran: Past and Present (Princeton University Press, Third Edition, 1955), p. 115. Wilber is an historian who, by his own admission, was also a CIA operative. He claims, in a later book, to have been the principal planner for the operation to overthrow Mossadegh (known as Operation AJAX), although he offers no evidence to support this assertion. He also states that Roosevelt’s book is full of factual errors. See Adventures in the Middle East (1986), pp. 187-8.
